This repository is *the submissions* and *my personal experimental code* of the outstanding course series *Programming Languages, Part A, B and C* by *Dan Grossman* on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages). This course is ranked 4.9 on Coursera.

The code is structured as `.sml` files in different folders, whose name indicates which part the code belongs to. There are also some personal investigational code that does not belongs to any particular part nor any specific week, and for those code, they are put in the folder `misc`.
